# Dev Tools and helpers

## gen_address.py

Creates a `poswallet.json` wallet with generated keys.

## Usage

If you have a python install (3.6+) you can already generate your PoS address and wallet.
It will be of no practical use for now, but well, at least you've got an address and could try PoS testnet once it's released.
- clone the repo
- python 3.6+
- pip3 install -r requirements.txt
- cd utils
- python3 gen_address.py
